# My Portfolio

Hey welcome mate. How are you? 
This is a basic project to learn the basis of git and github.

 Here, I am trying to build my personal portfolio.
I am a 4th year ECE student, who loves self learning and exploring new things.
I will update my skills once they are relevant enough to be showcased.
